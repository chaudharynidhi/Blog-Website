# Blog-Website

Through this website any one can post their blogs right there for the world to see. From starting till end I shall be posting my progress in making this website!!!

# Day1
I started my Django project and made the first django app named: Blog. Through this anyone can post their blogs of their interest. I hyave currently created a Database where the posts and the other details like: author name, date posted and contents are stored and then displayed at the frontend. I used the bootstrap library for styling purposes. Also a login page is created where the user can easily login and then to their feeds. More details will be added the next day!!
